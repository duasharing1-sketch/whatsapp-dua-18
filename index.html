const message = `*Ya Rabb, make my grave a garden of Jannah*

This powerful dua asks Allah ﷻ — by His Name Al-Waliyy (The Protecting Friend) and An-Noor (The Light) — to turn our graves into gardens of light, peace, mercy, and divine companionship.

Because the grave is our first step into the next life…

“The grave is either one of the gardens of Paradise, or one of the pits of Hell.”
 — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (Tirmidhi)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Waliyy (O Protecting Friend), as we enter our graves, make it a place of ease, happiness, peace, and contentment. Ya Noor (O Light), fill our graves with light, driving away all darkness and loneliness, and make it a garden from the gardens of Jannah (paradise), where we are embraced by Your mercy and favor. Protect us from the trials of the grave and the torment within it, and grant us righteous and loving companionship in there, so we are not alone.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
