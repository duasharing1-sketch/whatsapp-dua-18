Pause for a moment, turn your heart sincerely toward Allah, and read this short duʿāʾ for comfort and protection in the grave. Then forward it to 5 people to earn ongoing reward and duʿā.

*Niyyah*:

I intend this recitation of this du'a for myself, the compilers, the sharers, and the recipients.

*The Duʿāʾ*:

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Waliyy (O Protecting Friend), as we enter our graves, make it a place of ease, happiness, peace, and contentment. Ya Noor (O Light), fill our graves with light, driving away all darkness and loneliness, and make it a garden from the gardens of Jannah (paradise), where we are embraced by Your mercy and favor. Protect us from the trials of the grave and the torment within it, and grant us righteous and loving companionship in there, so we are not alone.

Because of the niyyah, when others recite this after you share it, you are included in their duʿāʾ. They will be praying for comfort and protection in the grave for you too.

This is 1 of 23 supplications from *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings*.

*Take a few seconds now and forward this to at least 5 people* — so the reward of spreading goodness increases for you, and duʿāʾs continue to be made for you with every sincere recitation.
