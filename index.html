This powerful dua asks Allah ﷻ — by His Name Al-Waliyy (The Protecting Friend) and An-Noor (The Light) — to turn our graves into gardens of light, peace, mercy, and divine companionship.

*The Duʿāʾ:*  

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Waliyy (O Protecting Friend), as we enter our graves, make it a place of ease, happiness, peace, and contentment. Ya Noor (O Light), fill our graves with light, driving away all darkness and loneliness, and make it a garden from the gardens of Jannah (paradise), where we are embraced by Your mercy and favor. Protect us from the trials of the grave and the torment within it, and grant us righteous and loving companionship in there, so we are not alone.

This duʿāʾ is part of the *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a growing chain of heartfelt duʿāʾs shared by countless believers like you, worldwide.

And because in an authentic hadith reported by Muʿādh ibn Anas (ra), Rasulullah ﷺ encouraged us to share beneficial knowledge, I humbly ask that you please forward this message far and wide — it only takes a few seconds, and your sharing can start a chain of duʿāʾs that continue returning to you from everyone it reaches.

When you share this message, you’re not simply sharing a duʿāʾ. You’re opening the door to countless people making sincere duʿāʾ for you daily — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying *“Ameen”* to every single one.

I make duʿāʾ that Allah accepts it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

*Ameen.*`;
